# Documentation

**This is still a work in progress**

This documentation is broken up into two types:

- Static markdown files
- Interactive python files (Jupyter notebooks)

Since the software is written in python, iPhython (or now
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)) is used for interactive documentation. Take a
look at the [docs](https://github.com/walchko/WalkingEye/tree/master/docs/ipython)
folder. The ipython files are where some of the development (e.g., gait,
forward/inverse kinematics, etc) takes place before it is tranferred into the
python code.

When viewing the notebooks on `github.com`, they are static, but if you download
them and have Jupyter installed, they are interactive and pretty cool.
